# JAVA
##To run my Java file

* when you copy to run a java file try to copy main method (like " public static void main(String[] args) {....}" )
* because the class file is not always same
* you can save the file as same as the class name, then you can copy the whole class
* but copy paste is not a good practice for a learner.
