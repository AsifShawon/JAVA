Sure! Here are some questions on the topics of inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces, file input/output, and exception handling in Java, ranging from simple to hard:

### Inheritance

**Simple:**
1. Explain the concept of inheritance in Java. How does it promote code reusability?
2. Write a Java program that demonstrates single inheritance. Create a base class `Animal` with a method `makeSound()`, and a derived class `Dog` that overrides the `makeSound()` method.

**Intermediate:**
1. Explain the difference between single inheritance and multilevel inheritance in Java. Provide code examples for both.
2. Write a Java program that demonstrates multilevel inheritance. Create a class `Animal`, which is inherited by `Mammal`, which in turn is inherited by `Dog`.

**Hard:**
1. Discuss the concept of constructor chaining in Java with an example.
2. Write a Java program that demonstrates hierarchical inheritance. Create a base class `Shape` with a method `draw()`, and two derived classes `Circle` and `Rectangle` that override the `draw()` method.

### Polymorphism

**Simple:**
1. What is polymorphism in Java? Explain with an example.
2. Write a Java program to demonstrate method overloading.

**Intermediate:**
1. Explain the difference between method overloading and method overriding in Java.
2. Write a Java program to demonstrate runtime polymorphism using method overriding.

**Hard:**
1. How does Java achieve runtime polymorphism? Discuss with an example.
2. Write a Java program to demonstrate polymorphism in the context of a real-world scenario, such as different types of employees in a company where each type has a different method for calculating the salary.

### Abstract Classes

**Simple:**
1. What is an abstract class in Java? How is it different from a regular class?
2. Write a Java program to create an abstract class `Shape` with an abstract method `draw()`. Create two subclasses `Circle` and `Rectangle` that provide implementations for the `draw()` method.

**Intermediate:**
1. Explain the purpose of abstract methods in Java. How do they contribute to the abstraction?
2. Write a Java program to demonstrate the use of an abstract class and abstract methods by modeling a simple vehicle system where each type of vehicle has a different way to start.

**Hard:**
1. Discuss the role of abstract classes in a complex Java application. Provide an example.
2. Write a Java program that defines an abstract class `Employee` with an abstract method `calculateSalary()`. Create subclasses `FullTimeEmployee` and `PartTimeEmployee` that implement the `calculateSalary()` method. Additionally, create a class to calculate and display the salary of different types of employees.

### Interfaces

**Simple:**
1. What is an interface in Java? How does it differ from an abstract class?
2. Write a Java program that defines an interface `Animal` with a method `makeSound()`. Implement this interface in two classes `Dog` and `Cat`.

**Intermediate:**
1. Can a Java class implement multiple interfaces? Explain with an example.
2. Write a Java program to demonstrate multiple inheritance in Java using interfaces. Define two interfaces `Flyable` and `Swimmable` with appropriate methods, and implement these interfaces in a class `Duck`.

**Hard:**
1. How do default methods in interfaces work in Java 8 and later? Provide an example.
2. Write a Java program to create a complex interface hierarchy. Define a base interface `Shape` with a method `draw()`, and two derived interfaces `Colorable` and `Resizable`. Create a class `ColoredResizableCircle` that implements all these interfaces.

### File Input/Output

**Simple:**
1. How do you read from and write to a file in Java? Provide a simple example.
2. Write a Java program to read text from a file named `input.txt` and display it on the console.

**Intermediate:**
1. Explain the difference between `FileReader` and `BufferedReader` in Java. Provide code examples.
2. Write a Java program to copy the contents of one file to another file.

**Hard:**
1. How do you handle character encoding while performing file I/O in Java? Discuss with an example.
2. Write a Java program to read data from a CSV file and display it in a tabular format on the console.

### Exception Handling

**Simple:**
1. What is exception handling in Java? Why is it important?
2. Write a Java program that demonstrates the use of `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks.

**Intermediate:**
1. Explain the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions in Java. Provide examples.
2. Write a Java program that demonstrates the use of multiple `catch` blocks to handle different types of exceptions.

**Hard:**
1. Discuss custom exceptions in Java. How do you create and use them? Provide an example.
2. Write a Java program that reads user input from the console and throws a custom exception `InvalidInputException` if the input does not meet specific criteria. Handle this exception in the program.
